Simple Windows Shutdown Utility
Lukas Hempel - hempel.lukas@gmail.com


This project is about creating a simple/reboot shutdown GUI tool for windows (mayhaps Linux in the future).
At the moment it is limited to german language until I figure out ressources in Visual Studio.
Additionally I simply want to know how git & github are working, simply put it's a learning experience for myself.

This tool is clearly inspired by 'Shutdown4U' but with more simplicity (and less features) in mind. 

What's working:
 - Shutdown/Reboot after chosen amount of time
 - Force close applications on shutdown/reboot
 - Save settings
 
 
What's to come:
 - two different modes: one working like it is now and one working with timers which means you will have to keep the application running but in return can change settings while the timer is activated
 - at least english language support
 - proper icon
 - (maybe Linux support)
